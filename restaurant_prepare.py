Restaurant Batch Preparer
Reads restaurant_latest.json, fetches article text, and creates
ready-to-paste batch files (prompt already included at the top).

Usage:
    python restaurant_prepare.py

Output:
    batch_1.txt, batch_2.txt, ... (each ready to paste directly into Claude)

You are an expert, precise data extractor specialized in retail and restaurant openings and closures. I will provide multiple news articles (each usually starting with its source URL). For EVERY article, extract the following information strictly and only from the text provided — no assumptions, no external knowledge, no guessing zip codes, no inferring dates or statuses:

🔍 Extract these fields
• Store/Shop/Restaurant Name
• Location or Full Address with zip code (if no zip code is mentioned, write exactly the address given; if no address at all, write "Address not specified")
• Event Type (write exactly "Opening" or "Closing" or "remodel" based only on the article content)
• Event Date
  - For openings → Opening Date
  - For closures → Closing Date (write exact date or month/year if mentioned; otherwise write exactly "Not specified")
• Status
  - For openings → use phrasing like: "under construction", "opening soon", "set to open", "recently opened", "grand opening on…", "planned for", etc.
  - For closures → use phrasing like: "closed", "permanently closed", "closing soon", "set to close", "shut down", "liquidation", etc.
  👉 Use the exact phrasing or closest direct wording from the article — do NOT invent or normalize
• Short Description (exactly 2–3 concise sentences summarizing ONLY what the article says — no opinions, no extra context)

📊 Output format
Create ONE clean Markdown table with these exact column headers (in this order):
| Store/Shop/Restaurant Name | Location or Full Address with zip code | Event Type | Event Date | Status | Short Description | Article Link |

📌 Rules
• Add one row per article in the order the articles are given
• If an article contains multiple businesses, create a separate row for each
• If an article includes both openings and closures, extract each separately
• If an article has zero relevant business opening or closure information, still include a row with:
  - Store Name: "No qualifying business found"
  - Other columns: "N/A"

🚫 Strict constraints
• ❌ No assumptions  • ❌ No external data  • ❌ No inferred addresses or dates  • ❌ No rewriting or normalizing status text

📎 Final section (mandatory)
At the very end of your response, add:
Non-working or unusable articles List:
• Article number — Reason (paywall / no business details / duplicate / text missing / etc.)
If none, write: None
